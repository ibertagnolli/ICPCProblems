# ICPCProblems
This is a repository with some of the problems my team did at the 2022 ICPC (inter collegiate programming competition) Rocky Mountain Regionals. Problems F and G were attempted but not finished. Every other problem that is here was attempted and accepted by the judges. We got 14th in our region and 5th at our location.

# Updates and Continuation 

As preparation for next year's ICPC I hope to continue to add competitive programming questions and attempts into this repo. I hope to also finish a few more of the problems from the 2022 ICPC competition and add them here as well.
